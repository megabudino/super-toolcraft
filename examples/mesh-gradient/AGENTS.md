# Toolcraft App Template Assembly Guide

This is a standalone Toolcraft template app generated from the base starter.

## Required Preflight

Treat this `AGENTS.md` as the active project contract. Before planning or editing app code, runtime code, controls, canvas, panels, renderer, timeline, layers, export, or tests:

1. Read `docs/toolcraft/workflow.md` in full.
2. Select every task route that matches the requested surface.
3. Read the selected routes' Plan phase before writing the spec or implementation plan.
4. Read their Implementation phase immediately before editing code.
5. Read their Verification phase before writing or running proof.

Process matching routes sequentially within the current phase and skip repeated documents already read in that phase. Open exactly one listed document per terminal or tool read, including documents from the same route and phase. Do not concatenate multiple documents, routes, or phases into one large output, and never continue from truncated output. Choose and record one verification tier for the coherent user-visible delivery batch before implementation. Do not edit implementation files until the Plan and Implementation preflight is complete.

## Quick Entry Contract

1. Build through `defineToolcraft` and `ToolcraftApp`.
2. Keep app state in Toolcraft runtime schema and commands.
3. Keep product output in `canvasContent`; never render app UI there. The signed host owns `ToolcraftApp`, bootstrap, routes, and global runtime styles; product code supplies only `ToolcraftAppComposition`. If upload/import is part of the source-material flow, do not invent canvas placeholder artwork, CTA copy, helper text, fake sample output, or preset source designs before real content exists.
4. Use built-in Toolcraft controls before custom controls. A visible model that users can rotate through 3D space, including a visually flat object with 3D rotation, uses schema `orientationGizmo` plus the runtime model-orbit interaction instead of Vector or a custom gizmo.
5. Do not hand-compose runtime surfaces or render built-in control components directly in app code; use `ToolcraftApp`, schema controls, `canvasContent`, `controlRenderers`, `onPanelAction`, and runtime commands.
6. Before writing controls, make and export `appControlSectionInventory`: each product controls section declares its title, product entity or workflow stage, targets, and grouping reason. Group by product meaning, not UI component type.
7. Keep control `label` short but semantically sufficient with the nearest visible section/group context, and put product-specific behavior help in schema `description`; runtime renders the label help tooltip only when that description adds meaning beyond the label.
8. Enable layers and timeline only when product behavior requires them, then test the real UI. Product animation loops are seamless forward-only by default: first and last frames stitch, direction does not reverse, and mirror/yoyo/ping-pong behavior requires explicit user intent.
9. Animated preview renderers suspend or coalesce non-essential animation work during canvas drag, pan, pinch, zoom, and radar/center interactions, then resume without changing user playback state.
10. If a Figma URL is provided, inspect the Figma file through MCP and rebuild from its structure; never implement from a screenshot or by eye.
11. If a video, GIF, screen recording, contact sheet, or extracted-frame sequence is provided as a reference, write a Video Reference Study before implementation: storyboard frames, frame-to-frame transition analysis, behavior decomposition, and acceptance mapping. Do not implement video references from a single screenshot or high-level summary.
12. Choose an explicit persistence policy; use schema `persistence` for user-edited app settings that should survive reload, and test real reload restoration when localStorage is enabled.
13. Generated apps follow the mandatory runtime Setup, canvas sizing, render scale, Timeline switch, Background, Image Export, Video Export, and sticky action rules in `docs/toolcraft/core/setup-export.md`. Do not duplicate or reinterpret those controls in app-authored sections.
14. Media uploads, image/file mode, source images, multi-upload sorting, default assets, and image transform actions follow `docs/toolcraft/core/media-upload.md`.
15. Keep `docs/toolcraft/agent-worklog.md` current with a decision trail, product decisions, explicit reference inputs, evidence, verification, and risks. Reference-runtime-clone apps also declare `referenceStudy` plus `referenceFeatureInventory` so every inspected reference feature has feature-level behavior evidence and maps to Toolcraft implementation and acceptance coverage.
16. Prove every visible entity through acceptance, browser, and performance coverage. Browser acceptance and performance pass only when protected helpers emit matching runtime evidence after successful assertions; source-code spelling and acceptance prose are not outcome authority. Declare typed conditional-visibility and background-output coverage, then use their fixed protected browser recipes. Generic acceptance outcomes prove command side effects only; use the fixed media, persistence, viewport, compound-control, layer, and timeline semantic recipes for specialized evidence.
17. Performance planning follows one sequence: reachable controls and inputs; workload dimensions and enforced boundaries; pass cost, frequency, lifecycle, and invalidation; render-plan assessment and protected kernel benchmark when required; derived paths and combined fixtures; targeted development checks; first stable full checkpoint. Keep `src/app/app-performance-impact.json` complete so post-baseline changes derive exact verification scope instead of rerunning the full suite. Details live in `docs/toolcraft/core/performance.md` and `docs/toolcraft/performance.md`.
18. Custom renderer apps compile one canonical `rendererPipelineRegistration`, supply it through `ToolcraftAppComposition`, reuse that registration as `rendererPipeline` in performance assessment, and derive paths and fixtures from it. The neutral starter has no registration, runtime provider, or fixture adapters.
19. Classify each coherent user-visible delivery batch with a verification tier before editing. Steering and fixes inside the same request stay in that batch. Use targeted checks for development feedback, then run the protected delivery gate once when the batch is ready.

## Starter Baseline

The generated folder starts as a neutral Toolcraft shell: canvas upload plus toolbar. It intentionally does not include demo controls, prompt fields, layers, or timeline. Do not treat test fixtures or documentation examples as product requirements. Add controls, timeline, layers, sticky actions, persistence, and custom renderers only after the requested product or reference app requires them.

When the folder becomes a real product, update `src/app/app-acceptance-data.ts` from `appProductReadiness.mode: "starter"` to `mode: "product"` and fill `productName`, `productSummary`, and `requestedBehavior`. Renamed product folders are not allowed to keep neutral starter readiness.

## License

This project includes Toolcraft source code available under the MIT License in `LICENSE.md`. `NOTICE.md` explains that generated apps include Toolcraft runtime, starter, UI component, documentation, and template source code.

## Local Reference Docs

Use this `AGENTS.md` as the entry contract. Use local docs for detail; the app must remain buildable without the website.

- `docs/toolcraft/workflow.md` — required preflight, task routing, worklog gate, and verification routing.
- `docs/toolcraft/core/runtime-boundary.md`, `docs/toolcraft/core/setup-export.md`, `docs/toolcraft/core/control-selection.md`, `docs/toolcraft/core/layout.md`, `docs/toolcraft/core/media-upload.md`, `docs/toolcraft/core/timeline-animation.md`, `docs/toolcraft/core/performance.md`, `docs/toolcraft/core/reference-study.md` — focused core modules routed by `workflow.md`.
- `docs/toolcraft/assembly-workflow.md` — runtime assembly, canvas output, and reference clone path.
- `docs/toolcraft/decision-contract.md` — rule ids, levels, and enforcement expectations.
- `docs/toolcraft/schema-reference.md` — schema authoring rules for `src/app/app-schema.ts`.
- `docs/toolcraft/component-rules.md` — slider, segmented, color, upload, image picker, vector, orientation gizmo, layers, timeline, and footer action rules.
- `docs/toolcraft/acceptance-testing.md` — app entity matrix and browser acceptance for `src/app/app-acceptance-data.ts`.
- `docs/toolcraft/performance.md` — performance roles, scenarios, and workload coverage for `src/app/app-performance.ts`.
- `docs/toolcraft/renderer-technique.md` — DOM, SVG, Canvas 2D, WebGL, and mixed renderer choices.
- `docs/toolcraft/agent-worklog.md` — implementation decision trail, evidence, verification, and remaining risks.
- `docs/toolcraft/custom-controls.md` — custom control registration through `controlRenderers`.

## Edit Surface

- Build the product through `src/app/app-composition.tsx`, `src/app/app-schema.ts`, and any focused product-owned modules imported by that composition. Product module location under `src` is unrestricted; the AST boundary and code-health inventory scan every product production module regardless of folder.
- Do not edit the signed framework bootstrap: `index.html`, `src/main.tsx`, `src/router.tsx`, `src/routes/index.tsx`, `src/routes/root.tsx`, or `src/styles.css`. The protected route owns the `ToolcraftApp` host and its `className`.
- Product styles use locally imported `*.module.css` files only. Every selector is anchored by a local class. A first-compound `:is()` or `:where()` is a valid local anchor only when every branch is locally anchored; `:not()` and `:has()` do not create an anchor. Do not add plain product CSS, CSS `@import`, package CSS imports, `:global`, bare/root selectors, sibling escapes, selectors that target Toolcraft host attributes, or global `<style>`/`CSSStyleSheet` injection.
- Product `import()` and `require()` specifiers are statically resolvable. Computed module loading is rejected in production and product tests. Production modules do not import product tests, test-support modules, or protected browser-evidence internals, directly or through product bridges; use the protected public acceptance/performance helpers instead of emitting reserved evidence.
- Product production modules form an acyclic dependency graph. Code health resolves relative imports, directory indexes, configured TypeScript aliases, and local package exports; type-only, external-package, test, and copied-framework edges are excluded. A failure reports the complete shortest cycle so ownership can be repaired instead of hidden behind a barrel or alias.
- Root Vite, Vitest, Playwright, and TypeScript verification configuration is signed platform code. Do not add alternate config files whose names resolve to those protected config families.
- Keep `src/app/app-acceptance-data.ts` aligned with every visible product entity.
- Do not edit `src/app/app-acceptance.ts`, `src/app/acceptance`, supplied `app-acceptance.*` meta-tests, or the generic browser acceptance harness. They are framework-owned files covered by the signed integrity manifest; add product-specific Vitest and Playwright tests in separate app-owned files.
- Keep `src/app/app-performance.ts` as app-specific performance matrix config only.
- Keep `src/app/app-performance-impact.json` aligned with every product production module and renderer pass. Classify implementation ownership there; do not infer verification scope from filenames during a later iteration.
- Use `e2e/app-kernel-benchmarks.ts` only for executable candidates required by `assessToolcraftRenderPlan`, then run protected `pnpm verify:kernel`. Do not put authored timing evidence in product files.
- Do not paste, restore, or duplicate runtime validators inside `src/app/app-performance.ts`.
- Do not edit the generated contract files under `docs/toolcraft` or the generated `LICENSE.md` and `NOTICE.md`; they are framework-owned and covered by the signed integrity manifest. `docs/toolcraft/agent-worklog.md` is the explicit editable exception for product decisions and verification evidence.
- Do not edit `src/toolcraft`. It is an immutable signed copy of the shared Toolcraft runtime; change the monorepo runtime and regenerate the app instead.
- Before delivery, replace the starter worklog with `Mode: product`, add one `Decision Trail` entry per coherent user-visible delivery batch, and record concrete decisions for renderer, timeline, layers, controls, export, and performance. Each entry names the user-visible result, source/reference checked, contract rules applied, rejected alternatives, state/output mapping, focused development checks, and protected delivery result. `npm run test` fails if the worklog is missing, lacks the decision trail, or still describes the neutral starter.
- `npm run test` includes Toolcraft source integrity and local docs checks. If a desired control style is missing, fix the schema or regenerate from the upstream template/runtime; do not patch copied `src/toolcraft` files for one app.

## Decision Contract Rule IDs

These ids mirror `TOOLCRAFT_DECISION_CONTRACT` in `@/toolcraft/runtime`. Keep this list synced so standalone instructions do not drift from runtime validators.

[//]: # (toolcraft-contract:decision-rule-list:start)

- `canvas-no-app-ui`
- `canvas-surface-preserved`
- `canvas-handle-placement`

## Runtime Contract

- Use `defineToolcraft` from `@/toolcraft/runtime`.
- Export an `appComposition` satisfying `ToolcraftAppComposition` from `src/app/app-composition.tsx`.
- Keep product composition limited to `schema`, `canvasContent`, `controlRenderers`, `onPanelAction`, `renderDefaultCanvasMedia`, and optional `rendererPipelineRegistration`; host `className` and `style` are not product extension points.
- Custom renderers use one compiled `rendererPipelineRegistration` as the canonical declaration for runtime execution and new-envelope performance assessment. Product code receives only the disposal-free pipeline client through hooks and panel action context.
- Do not import `ToolcraftApp`, low-level runtime surfaces, or built-in controls into product modules. The signed host renders the shell; product modules use schema controls and supported composition fields.
- Use `renderDefaultCanvasMedia={false}` when a custom renderer replaces the default media preview.
- Use `ToolcraftApp onPanelAction` for sticky footer product actions such as Generate, Apply, Export, Copy, or Download.
- Keep final app behavior in the schema and runtime command bus, not in isolated local control state.
- For animated products, write an Animation Intent Inventory before coding: use top playback timeline for product transport, keyframes timeline for editable property animation, and no timeline only for explicitly autonomous decorative output with no video export. Any app with `Export Video` must enable the top Toolcraft timeline.
- For keyframes timeline apps, renderers read keyframed settings through Toolcraft evaluated-value helpers/hooks. Do not parse timeline `valueLabel` strings or read raw `state.values` for keyframed targets.
- Use schema `defaultValue` for every resettable control.
- Route editor-owned actions through runtime commands such as `controls.reset`, `media.import`, `media.delete`, `canvas.center`, `history.undo`, and `history.redo`.

## AI Workflow Skills And Local Fallback

The signed local `AGENTS.md` and `docs/toolcraft/*` files are the mandatory workflow authority. Use the named workflow skills when the environment provides them; they improve execution but are not a prerequisite for a standalone generated app to remain buildable and verifiable.

- Before writing or changing an app spec, use `brainstorming` to decide product behavior, canvas sizing mode, panels, media flow, controls, export/copy behavior, renderer technique, timeline/layer choice, and ambiguous requirements.
- Before editing code from an approved spec, use `writing-plans` to produce a deterministic implementation plan focused on app files, tests, build, and browser verification.
- Before fixing any broken control, failed test, build failure, visual mismatch, export issue, or runtime regression, use `systematic-debugging` to find the root cause first.
- When the prompt includes a Figma URL, use Figma MCP/design context before implementation. Read the actual node, layer, component, variable, and asset structure; screenshots are only for final visual QA, not the source of truth.
- After implementation, use the `browser` workflow or equivalent local browser verification to test the running app, not only typecheck/build output. The default browser gate is `npm run test:browser`; it excludes every Playwright test whose name contains `browser perf:`, including performance audit and budget scenarios. `npm run test:browser:perf` is reserved for full performance checkpoints.
- Run `npm run ai:check` before app generation or major changes. It enforces local code health, the product AST boundary, and external skill availability. With an explicit `--no-install` generation the AST pass reports that it is deferred; normal `npm run test` and every final gate require installed dependencies and run the full boundary.
- If a workflow skill is missing and installation is available, install it and refresh the session. If installation is unavailable or the app was generated with `--no-skills`, continue through the equivalent signed local workflow instead of stopping or weakening verification.
- Do not silently ignore a missing workflow capability: follow the matching local requirement in this file and `docs/toolcraft/workflow.md`, and record the fallback in the implementation plan or worklog.
- The Toolcraft app contract overrides generic brainstorming approval and visual-companion rituals. If the user asks to build or port an app, that request is approval to produce the spec, plan, implementation, tests, build, and local run unless a product-critical ambiguity remains.
- Do not ask the user to confirm decisions already covered by this contract, the prompt, or the reference app. Record the decision in the spec and continue.
- Do not ask whether to enable a browser companion during brainstorming. Browser verification is mandatory after the app runs locally.
- In standalone folders that are not git repositories, save spec/plan files without asking about commit requirements.

## Verification Tier Classifier

Before editing, write one short verification note for the coherent delivery batch:

```md
Verification tier: Tier N
Reason: <changed surface and expected blast radius>
Run: <commands and browser checks>
Skip: <checks not needed for this pass and why>
```

Choose the tier by blast radius, not by line count. If uncertain, move one tier higher, not automatically to the full final gate.

| Tier                                          | Use When                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | Required Checks                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| --------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Tier 0 — docs/copy                            | Documentation, comments, copy, labels, or titles change without schema targets, values, runtime behavior, renderer output, or layout mechanics.                                                                                                                                                | Targeted docs/typecheck or targeted app test. Browser is not required unless visual text fitting is the risk.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| Tier 1 — local control presentation           | One control or panel visual state changes: spacing, hover, focus, disabled, marker visibility, label fit, or component variant display. Runtime state shape and product renderer are unchanged.                                                                                                | Targeted unit/component test plus one focused browser check for the affected control or panel.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| Tier 2 — schema/product behavior              | Controls, sections, defaults, persistence, panel actions, export actions, acceptance rows, or product behavior mapping changes.                                                                                                                                                                | During development run relevant targeted tests and browser acceptance. At delivery, pass exact selectors to `npm run verify:delivery`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Tier 3 — renderer/canvas/runtime feature      | Custom renderer, animation loop, canvas sizing, upload/media, timeline, layers, toolbar, export bytes, WebGL/Canvas/SVG output, zoom, radar, history, heavy control behavior changes, or a post-generation iteration that touches renderer workload or viewport stability.                     | During development run targeted browser acceptance and only affected performance scenarios. At delivery, `verify:delivery` executes the exact impact-derived set once.                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Tier 4 — final delivery/template architecture | Fresh generated app completion, folder export, commit-ready delivery, dependency changes, runtime/template/contract/CLI changes, broad refactors, or major post-generation iterations that rewrite renderer, canvas, animation, timeline/keyframes, layers, media, export, or control mapping. | Fresh folders run `npm install` once. Run `npm run verify:delivery` once when the coherent batch is ready, then start `npm run dev`. Its protected lifecycle creates the first baseline once or uses targeted proof for later delivery.                                                                                                                                            |

Do not rerun `npm install` after every edit. Run it after fresh export, dependency changes, lockfile changes, or a missing package error.

Do not run the full browser performance suite for Tier 0-2 edits.

Run a full performance checkpoint only at two events: once inside `npm run verify:delivery` when the app first reaches a stable working product version; or inside `npm run verify:delivery -- --reason=explicit-performance-work` when the user explicitly asks to optimize performance, fix lag, remove jank, speed up animation, stabilize drag/zoom, or otherwise complains about performance. A normal later delivery cannot silently refresh the full baseline. Use the current AI agent's controlled browser for targeted diagnosis.

Feature loops after the first working version do not run aggregate gates or the full performance suite after every edit. Run only the smallest affected checks while implementation is changing. At the delivery boundary, `verify:delivery` compares against the immediately previous successful delivery and runs exact affected checks once. Filename, verification tier, and touched subsystem do not trigger the full suite by themselves. Record targeted development checks and the single delivery result in the verification note or worklog.

The first stable working product app version is not complete until `npm run verify:delivery` has produced the durable full-checkpoint baseline and protected delivery receipt. Agent-controlled browser checks remain useful for targeted diagnosis and visual verification, but terminal prose cannot mint either receipt. After the first delivery, exact `--unit-test`, `--browser-test`, and `--performance-test` selectors go to `verify:delivery`; the impact inventory derives the minimum tier and affected passes from the immediately previous successful delivery. A bare tier, prose claim, or product-authored report is invalid.

## Required Checks

For a coherent delivery batch, run:

```bash
npm run verify:delivery
npm run dev
```

The protected runner selects first-stable aggregate proof, ordinary targeted proof, or explicit performance refresh from its receipts. Do not run `verify:quick`, `verify:perf`, `verify:perf:record-iteration`, or `verify:final` before or after a successful `verify:delivery` for unchanged source; they remain compatibility and focused-CI commands.

Use `npm install` before this final gate when the folder is fresh or dependencies changed.

`verify:delivery` runs the protected integrity checker directly and does not depend only on a mutable package script. `npm run test` must still include local docs and app tests. `npm run verify:ui` / `npm run test:browser` must run against the real app UI and product output but must not run any Playwright test whose name contains `browser perf:`. The protected full-performance path builds and serves the current production bundle, then runs the performance audit plus browser budget suite sequentially so budgets exclude dev-server transformation and unrelated parallel e2e noise.

Do not stop or kill existing local servers to free a port during a first start. `npm run dev`, `npm run preview`, and browser verification prefer port `3002`, but automatically move to the next free port only while assigning this app's first saved port. After a saved port exists, normal `npm run dev` / `npm run preview` uses that same port; if that port is already serving this app, report that existing URL instead of starting a duplicate. Use `TOOLCRAFT_PORT`, `TOOLCRAFT_DEV_PORT`, or `TOOLCRAFT_TEST_PORT` only to change the preferred starting port before a saved port exists. A dev/preview launch is successful only after the selected port serves this app's Toolcraft server identity endpoint plus the `toolcraft-app-title` marker from `index.html`; never report a URL just because some server is listening there. When deliberately restarting this app server, use `npm run dev:restart` or `npm run preview:restart`; restart mode reuses the previously saved app port, stops the listener on that exact port if it is still running, force-stops it if it does not release the port, starts on the same port again, and verifies the identity before saving/reporting the port.

## App Completion Bar

The app is complete only when:

- the Toolcraft runtime shell is present;
- `canvasContent` contains product output only;
- the runtime canvas backing remains visible behind product output;
- every visible control affects runtime state and product output or a command side effect;
- reset returns schema controls to `defaultValue`;
- sticky footer export actions operate on final product output at `state.canvas.size`;
- still products expose Export PNG; animated products expose Export Video plus Export PNG;
- PNG export uses the required `Background` section with `Include` plus unlabeled background color runtime controls, live preview hides product background when Include is off, and video keeps background;
- every PNG export includes `Image Export` format/resolution `select` controls, and passes `export.image.resolution` into `createToolcraftPngExportCanvas`;
- animated products with both PNG and video export place `Image Export` immediately before `Video Export`;
- export paths use the standard export helpers: PNG uses selected image resolution or retina fallback, while video uses current canvas/output size or the selected 4K target;
- layers are absent for single-layer apps and fully working when enabled;
- timeline is absent, playback, keyframes, or custom reference timeline according to product behavior;
- performance checks cover workload and responsiveness for all relevant controls;
- detail-heavy or animated custom renderers pass real viewport drag and zoom stress checks;
- workload browser perf tests execute the compiled development or maximum fixture for the canonical derived path, apply every adapter value through the real UI, and observe every dimension before measurement;
- bounded numeric workload ranges and hard limits are derived from schema; scenario values cannot redefine them, custom metrics cannot bypass them, many-item fixtures apply at least 10 real items, and degraded ceilings prove every exact 10 percent step with matching scenario/target identity;
- browser tests verify upload/clear, controls, canvas sizing, toolbar, timeline/layers when enabled, sticky actions, output dimensions, and viewport stability.
