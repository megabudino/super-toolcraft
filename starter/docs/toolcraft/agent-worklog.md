# Implementation Worklog

This file records product decisions and the evidence behind them. Keep it short, factual, and current. Update it after schema, renderer, timeline, layer, export, performance, or acceptance decisions.

## Status

Mode: starter

The neutral starter has no product renderer, timeline, layers, export behavior, or performance workload yet. Replace this status with `Mode: product` when the folder becomes a real app.

## Automatic Delivery Lifecycle

Keep this worklog human-shaped. For the first product delivery, record the request, decisions, state/output mapping, reference evidence, rejected alternatives, and known risks; one bare `pnpm verify:delivery` derives complete contract proof, one build, full functional acceptance, and no measured performance. For later ordinary edits, record new intent and material decisions, the exact unit/component test, and acceptance IDs passed to `pnpm test:feature`; selector expansion is automatic, while explicit `--all` records why the edit could not be bounded. Do not claim or run another aggregate functional delivery.

Classifier output establishes complaint authority only and never path localization. A localized performance complaint adds the domain authority below, then one bare `pnpm verify:delivery` runs one targeted iteration. If localization remains unresolved regardless of classifier result, ask one user-facing question naming visible operations and offering targeted diagnosis or a complete review; record neither `performance-iteration` intent nor canonical path authority until the answer supplies exact localization evidence. Never ask the user to choose internal path IDs. A broad or honestly unlocalizable problem may present that single choice with a recommendation for complete review, but the user still chooses. A direct complete-review request needs no further clarification. The full audit remains separate and requires an explicit operator request or accepted offer before `pnpm verify:perf` may run. Protected receipts own changed files, plans, checks, reports, measurements, and pass/fail evidence.

When `canvas.renderScale` is enabled, record the renderer decision to preserve selected backing quality and map it to functional `renderScaleCoverage` for interaction and steady state, plus playback when timeline is enabled. The worklog may name the protected `canvas-render-scale-backing` recipe, but it cannot claim its evidence or turn a quality failure into performance authority.

## Performance Iteration Entry Contract

For high-confidence ordinary work, record `Performance intent: ordinary-product-work`. For unresolved localization, whether classification returned high-confidence `performance-iteration` or `needs-agent-judgment`, record the unresolved visible operation but no `Performance intent: performance-iteration` field or `Performance paths` until the user's one clarification provides exact localization. For a localized performance complaint or post-clarification targeted choice, record exactly these domain fields in the latest iteration:

```md
- Performance intent: performance-iteration
- Performance request evidence: "<verbatim exact Request quote>"
- Performance paths: ["performance-path:%5B...%5D"]
- Verification: One bare `pnpm verify:delivery` will derive and run the protected proof.
```

The quoted evidence must be an exact nontrivial raw substring of `Request` with identical whitespace and Unicode code units. `Performance paths` must be a non-empty unique JSON array of canonical path IDs. Do not record command arguments, changed-file inventory, executed checks, reports, or measurements; the protected planner and receipt own that machine evidence. Each localized complaint or post-clarification targeted choice authorizes one bounded iteration; after it passes, return the app and wait for user evaluation. Classifier output or complaint evidence alone never supplies path localization or authorizes full certification. The separate operator command is permitted only after the user explicitly requests a complete audit or explicitly accepts the agent's offer; the user does not need to name the command.

## Decision Trail

### Iteration 1 — Model appearance and presentation runtime contract

- Request: Preserve authored model materials and textures from folders or ZIP packages, use a Blender-like fallback only when authored appearance is absent, render the result on the canvas, and keep direct orbit synchronized with the orientation gizmo.
- Task type: Runtime, starter, contract, CLI, and generated-app delivery.
- User-visible result: GLB/glTF/OBJ/FBX/PLY/STL imports now retain the supported authored appearance subset, folder and ZIP resources remain durable, missing appearance resources surface typed warnings, and materialless geometry uses the canonical fallback. Runtime preview keeps one presentation lease and one camera pose for canvas rendering, direct model drag, gizmo snap, history, reset, and export.
- Source/reference checked: `/Users/kusnizza/Projects/toolcraft-apps/rain-drops`, the production model adapters, canonical document codecs, binary repository reachability, runtime canvas/model presentation, and generated-app browser evidence.
- Reference inputs: The user selected preservation for both folder and ZIP imports, fallback only when authored material is absent, and the current Toolcraft application contract as the source of truth.
- Docs/contracts read: `core/runtime-boundary.md`, `core/media-upload.md`, `core/performance.md`, `renderer-technique.md`, `acceptance-testing.md`, and the runtime decision/component contracts.
- Contract rules applied: `canvas-surface-preserved`, `interaction-surface-ownership`, `renderer-view-interaction`, `renderer-technique-inventory`, `acceptance-product-observable`, `performance-coverage-levels`, and `persistence-policy-explicit`.
- View interaction intent: A visible editable model uses `orbit`; runtime canvas drag and `orientationGizmo` consume the same orientation target without mutating canonical source data.
- Interaction ownership: Canvas owns direct spatial orbit and gizmo snap. The panel owns source package selection, status, warning, repair, and removal actions.
- Decision: Preserve immutable source packages and canonical appearance data; build a disposable Three.js projection with bounded batching/deduplication only for pixel-equivalent opaque geometry. Retain the renderer prewarm resource across remove/reimport and dispose it with the owning presentation host.
- Alternatives rejected: Product-owned model loaders, remote texture fallback, storing Three.js objects in state, appearance-driven topology repair, duplicate standard/custom presentation owners, and metadata-only browser evidence.
- State/output mapping: Durable package refs and canonical document refs live in runtime media state; resolved appearance resources feed a shared presentation lease; evaluated orientation state feeds preview, hit testing, gizmo, history/reset, and export.
- Performance intent: ordinary-product-work
- Verification: One bare `pnpm verify:delivery` will derive and run the protected proof.
- Risks: The canonical contract intentionally covers static geometry and the documented PBR subset; unsupported skins, morph targets, animation clips, texture transforms, or missing resources remain nonfatal diagnostics when possible. Synthetic browser fixtures prove contract behavior but cannot guarantee every malformed third-party exporter file.

### Iteration 2 — Infinity canvas runtime and scene-cropped export

- Request: Add an `Infinity canvas` toggle to the first Project Settings section; when enabled, remove canvas size controls and artboard limits, use the whole workspace, and export a crop around scene elements.
- Task type: Runtime, canvas, export, acceptance, starter contract, documentation, CLI, and generated-app delivery.
- User-visible result: Project Settings now starts with `Infinity canvas`. Enabling it removes aspect ratio, width, and height controls plus the finite artboard boundary; disabling it restores the exact previous finite dimensions. Image export remains full-artboard in finite mode and crops to visible scene bounds in infinite mode.
- Source/reference checked: Current Toolcraft canvas state, canvas viewport, image/model presentation, panel action boundary, generated product fixture, export pipeline, and the user-approved crop behavior.
- Reference inputs: The user explicitly selected an unrestricted infinite workspace, preservation of the current finite size, and export by the outer scene-element bounds.
- Docs/contracts read: `core/setup-export.md`, `core/runtime-boundary.md`, `acceptance-testing.md`, `schema-reference.md`, and the runtime decision/component contracts.
- Contract rules applied: `canvas-surface-preserved`, `controls-product-coverage`, `output-export-required`, `acceptance-product-observable`, and `infinity-canvas-scene-bounds`.
- View interaction intent: Infinity mode changes the canvas extent only; existing product `viewInteraction` and model orbit/gizmo ownership remain unchanged.
- Interaction ownership: Project Settings owns the finite/infinite mode. The canvas owns navigation across the unbounded workspace. Export actions consume canonical scene bounds without adding a second editing surface.
- Decision: Store the mode in canonical runtime state and history; retain finite dimensions while infinite; give runtime images and models explicit world frames; accept product bounds through the signed composition boundary; union only visible exportable entities; and reject empty, unavailable, or oversized scene exports with typed visible feedback.
- Alternatives rejected: Encoding Infinity as a sentinel width/height, deriving bounds from DOM pixels, always calling product bounds in finite mode, exporting the current viewport, retaining hidden/editor-only entities, and an implicit global bounds registry.
- State/output mapping: `canvas.setMode` drives settings visibility and artboard layout. Runtime image/model frames and `sceneBoundsProvider` feed one canonical resolver. Image and model compositors render the resolved scene frame at export scale; video exporters must resolve a bound over their explicit time range.
- Performance intent: ordinary-product-work
- Verification: One bare `pnpm verify:delivery` will derive and run the protected proof.
- Risks: Product-owned visual entities must provide truthful bounds through `sceneBoundsProvider`; the runtime fails closed with `scene-bounds-unavailable` instead of silently cropping them out.

### Iteration 3 — Grass controls-panel section navigation parity

- Request: "возьми механику навигации по секциям панели из этого проекта. перенеси полностью дизайн и поведение в стартер. панель появляется когда секции не влезают в высоту одного экрана"
- Task type: Shared runtime, controls-panel interaction, generated browser evidence, starter documentation, and standalone generation.
- User-visible result: Generated Toolcraft apps use the Grass section-navigation popup only while the controls body overflows its available viewport. A fitting panel cannot reveal the popup; losing overflow clears pending hover intent, and restoring overflow requires a fresh 300ms dwell.
- Source/reference checked: `/Users/kusnizza/Projects/toolcraft-apps/grass`, its generated runtime copy, the live app at `http://127.0.0.1:3003/`, canonical runtime/UI sources, and computed popup geometry and typography.
- Reference inputs: The user selected full Grass design and behavior, with navigation eligibility determined by sections not fitting within one screen height.
- Docs/contracts read: `component-rules.md`, `workflow.md`, `acceptance-testing.md`, and the runtime panel component contract.
- Contract rules applied: `panel-host-behavior`, `controls-component-layout-invariants`, `controls-layout-heuristics`, and `acceptance-product-observable`.
- Interaction ownership: The runtime controls panel owns overflow measurement, hover intent, section scroll-spy, and popup navigation. Product code supplies sections only and cannot render a duplicate navigation surface.
- Decision: Keep one runtime implementation, retain the complete Grass surface, spacing, type, scrolling, pointer corridor, timing, click, and keyboard behavior, and reset every pending popup timer when overflow disappears.
- Alternatives rejected: Copying the component into starter product code, retaining navigation state after overflow disappears, showing navigation persistently, and editing the exported Grass folder instead of the source runtime.
- State/output mapping: `scrollHeight > clientHeight + 1` makes navigation eligible; a 300ms dwell in the inner-left 12px strip mounts the runtime popup; its items map visible non-sticky sections to immediate viewport scroll positions.
- Performance intent: ordinary-product-work
- Verification: One bare `pnpm verify:delivery` will derive and run the protected proof.
- Risks: Already-exported applications retain their copied runtime until regenerated; the Grass reference remains unchanged.

### Iteration 4 — Runtime history keyboard shortcuts from focused controls

- Request: Make Undo and Redo work through standard keyboard shortcuts in generated apps.
- Task type: Shared runtime, generated keyboard interaction, contract, and standalone browser evidence.
- User-visible result: Cmd/Ctrl+Z, Cmd/Ctrl+Shift+Z, and Ctrl+Y operate Toolcraft history while focus remains on sliders, switches, checkboxes, and other non-text controls; active text editors keep native text undo.
- Source/reference checked: The runtime ToolcraftRoot shortcut listener, its unit tests, and a built standalone app where the focused Blur slider input reproduced the failure.
- Contract rules applied: `runtime-shell-required`, `interaction-surface-ownership`, `acceptance-product-observable`, and `workflow-required`.
- Interaction ownership: ToolcraftRoot owns one document-level history shortcut listener; product apps do not register duplicates.
- Decision: Classify input targets by native text-editing capability instead of treating every input as a text editor.
- Alternatives rejected: Always stealing text undo, per-control marker attributes, and app-local shortcut listeners.
- State/output mapping: Recognized shortcuts dispatch `history.undo`/`history.redo` through the runtime command bus; native text editors return before dispatch.
- Performance intent: ordinary-product-work
- Verification: One bare `pnpm verify:delivery` will derive and run the protected proof.
- Risks: Previously exported apps retain their copied runtime until regenerated; newly generated apps receive the fix through the CLI copy path.

### Iteration 5 — Blender-compatible orientation gizmo interaction

- Request: Make the orientation gizmo behave "все как в блендере": click signed points to return to axes and drag the gizmo with Blender-equivalent rotation.
- Task type: Shared runtime interaction, generated browser evidence, starter contract, and website documentation.
- User-visible result: The existing 70px Toolcraft gizmo keeps its size, colors, hover treatment, and 16px placement. Users can now drag anywhere inside its circular surface; gizmo and direct model drag share Blender factory Turntable sensitivity and pole recovery; signed-axis clicks use Blender Smooth View timing.
- Source/reference checked: Blender 4.5.2 LTS factory preferences plus the official navigation gizmo, view rotate, axis view, and smooth-view source. Factory Turntable sensitivity is 0.4 degrees per CSS pixel and Smooth View is 200ms maximum, scaled by quaternion angle.
- Contract rules applied: `canvas-handle-placement`, `interaction-surface-ownership`, `renderer-view-interaction`, `acceptance-product-observable`, `performance-coverage-levels`, and `workflow-required`.
- View interaction intent: A visible editable spatial model remains `orbit`; the runtime gizmo and visible-model hit surface consume one canonical `{ position, up }` target.
- Interaction ownership: An unmodified primary press inside the gizmo circle owns Turntable drag; a signed endpoint also owns click-to-axis; blank click is inert; outside-circle and model-miss presses remain canvas pan.
- Decision: Map Blender Z-up behavior to Toolcraft Y-up, use fixed world-up yaw plus screen-horizontal pitch with Blender's pole horizon blend, keep a 3px click/drag threshold, and use cubic smoothstep quaternion slerp with `200ms * angle / pi` duration.
- Alternatives rejected: Keeping endpoint-only sphere projection, changing only gizmo math while direct model drag remains viewport-scaled, and adopting a Three.js helper that owns a separate camera/controller.
- Licensing: This is an independent behavioral and mathematical reimplementation from documented behavior and observed source structure; no Blender GPL source code is copied.
- State/output mapping: Every drag or snap writes the canonical runtime pose under one history group and target-scoped interaction lease. Preview, hit testing, gizmo projection, reset/undo/redo, persistence, and export continue to consume that pose; stale gestures cannot write after a newer owner.
- Performance intent: ordinary-product-work
- Verification: One bare `pnpm verify:delivery` will derive and run the protected proof.
- Risks: Already-exported applications retain their copied runtime until regenerated. Browser proof relies on the runtime gizmo's canonical pose/target attributes and intentionally fails closed if the real handle is absent or ambiguous.

### Iteration 6 — Executable product-control applicability

- Request: Fix starter contracts so generated products show only settings that apply to the selected type and cannot pass delivery with a visible control that the renderer ignores.
- Task type: Shared runtime schema, controls-panel visibility, starter acceptance, protected browser evidence, generated fixtures, CLI, and documentation.
- User-visible result: Every generated product control explicitly declares `always` or `conditional` applicability. Non-matching controls disappear without losing their values, while every visible finite sibling branch must prove the control's real accepted product outcome.
- Source/reference checked: Badge behavior was used only as failure evidence; implementation scope remained the Toolcraft runtime and starter contracts. The legacy `visibleWhen` runtime path, control-section inventory, acceptance requirement derivation, reporter, and generated image/video/material fixtures were inspected.
- Contract rules applied: `controls-product-coverage`, `controls-section-inventory-required`, `controls-component-layout-invariants`, `acceptance-product-observable`, and `workflow-required`.
- Interaction ownership: The runtime owns applicability normalization and panel presence. Product schemas own explicit applicability claims. Existing product acceptance owns actions and outcomes; the applicability layer only derives the branch cases in which those outcomes must be reproved.
- Decision: Normalize explicit applicability, legacy `visibleWhen`, and omitted low-level input into one resolved model with origin metadata; reject legacy/implicit origins for product controls; combine conditional predicates with AND; derive pairwise cases from semantic section peers; preserve the authored `Background` inventory ownership after runtime relocates its product controls into `Setup`; attach case-scoped evidence only after exact presence/absence and real outcome assertions pass.
- Alternatives rejected: Extending optional `visibleWhen`, selector-owned target lists, renderer dependency inference, acceptance prose heuristics, Cartesian branch enumeration, and Badge-specific logic.
- State/output mapping: Applicability reads canonical runtime target values and changes only panel presence. Hidden values remain in runtime state, persistence, transfer, and history. Matching cases reuse the control's existing preview, rendered-pixel, artifact, command, or semantic proof.
- Performance intent: ordinary-product-work
- Verification: One bare `pnpm verify:delivery` remains the generated-app delivery authority; this runtime/template contract delivery also runs the monorepo checks required by the repository entry contract.
- Risks: Pairwise proof depends on truthful Control Section Inventory grouping; unsupported selector domains fail acceptance instead of silently skipping cases. Legacy low-level consumers remain readable but cannot satisfy generated product acceptance.

### Iteration 7 — Evidence-backed adaptive motion reference study

- Request: Make video-reference analysis detailed enough to retain brief behavior changes, choose review density from the source instead of a small fixed frame count, and keep first delivery plus later app refinement fast and contract-correct.
- Task type: Cross-cutting runtime, starter, protected delivery, CLI packaging, documentation, and generated-app lifecycle architecture.
- User-visible result: An explicitly registered motion reference is scanned across every decoded frame, reviewed through dense 12 FPS overview evidence plus retained event/focus windows, and automatically split into complete studies of at most 120 reviewed frames. Typed behavior mappings require exact automated evidence and browser `reference-parity`; a product with no registered reference performs no FFmpeg work.
- Source/reference checked: `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-11-video-reference-evidence-design.md`, `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-08-11-video-reference-evidence.md`, runtime decision/component contracts, `core/reference-study.md`, protected delivery planning/reporting, CLI prepack generation, proof-process execution, atomic publication leases/journals, and fresh generated standalone applications.
- Reference inputs: The neutral starter remains `referenceInputs: []` and contains no invented reference asset. Reproducible analysis begins only after a source is explicitly registered and materialized at a repository-accessible path.
- Contract rules applied: `video-reference-analysis`, `reference-clone-source-of-truth`, `acceptance-product-observable`, `performance-coverage-levels`, and `workflow-required`.
- Decision: Use one typed `referenceInputs` boundary with nested partition studies. Separate source inspection, full-frame change scanning, adaptive selection, reviewed-frame materialization, canonical evidence validation, contact-sheet creation, semantic classification, and atomic group publication. Keep focus refinements on the same study identity when segment bounds stay stable; retire the complete previous group in one source-scoped journal transaction when partition identities change.
- Publication decision: Resolve artifact, staging, and transaction roots before mutation; bind staging children to canonical study IDs; keep journal residue outside the committed artifact root; renew token-owned leases; restore the complete old group on failure; and isolate concurrent sources while serializing one source identity.
- Alternatives rejected: Fixed 13-frame sampling, single-screenshot or prose-only storyboard authority, app-local/manual evidence artifacts, partial per-study publication, implicit preprocessing during generation or delivery, legacy `videoReferenceStudy` compatibility, product-authored test selection, measured performance triggered by functional work, and a second hand-maintained framework inventory.
- State/output mapping: Registered source bytes produce canonical source/reference identity, machine evidence JSON, and a contact sheet. Typed studies classify detected events and phases; behavior mappings name `acceptanceId` plus `motionReferenceCoverage`; protected automated evidence and browser `reference-parity` prove the resulting product behavior. Exact study resource paths remain functional verification owners.
- Validation fixtures: A packaged no-reference app completed initial delivery with 435/435 Vitest tests, build, 14/14 browser scenarios, zero FFmpeg/ffprobe calls, and null performance state. A 12.000333-second, 30 FPS, 360-frame FFV1 source retained one-frame events near frames 91 and 271, produced two bounded studies with 109 and 40 reviewed frames and a 149-frame unique reviewed union, and used one full scan plus one union extraction.
- Lifecycle evidence: Reference initial delivery completed 435/435 tests, build, and 14/14 browser scenarios including real reference parity. The unchanged gate completed in 0.4 seconds without build, tests, browser, FFmpeg, or performance. A focus refinement atomically changed evidence under the same study IDs with no staging, transaction, journal, or backup residue; later delivery selected 7 affected files, 33/33 tests, build, one browser scenario, and `animation.speed` only. A separate boundary-changing fixture proved two old partition IDs are retired when two new IDs replace them.
- Verification: `pnpm starter:docs-check`, `pnpm starter:test`, `pnpm starter:typecheck`, `pnpm cli:test`, `pnpm cli:typecheck`, runtime tests/typecheck, website typecheck/docs sync, `pnpm ai:check`, `pnpm build`, packaged fallback execution, 199/199 motion-reference tests, root/staging/crash/isolation regressions, and repeated fresh packaged no-reference/reference lifecycles. Sandbox-only localhost bind failures were repeated with the exact commands outside the sandbox and passed.
- Performance intent: ordinary functional contract work. Measured performance was intentionally not run; every generated receipt kept current performance and performance baseline null.
- Risks: FFmpeg and ffprobe are required only for the explicit `reference:study` command. An undeclared chat attachment is not reproducible repository evidence and must be registered before implementation. Previously generated apps retain their copied framework until regenerated. Supported evidence is limited to the documented source/timing formats and fails closed on ambiguous timing, malformed groups, unsafe paths, or incomplete artifacts.

### Iteration 8 — Initial-only aggregate verification lifecycle

- Request: Keep complete checks after the first product build, but make every later ordinary edit use only the tests for the functionality being changed instead of rerunning delivery, export, browser, or performance matrices.
- Task type: Starter lifecycle, protected receipts, CLI generation, runtime policy, contract documentation, and generated-app workflow.
- User-visible result: A generated app still receives one complete functional proof before its first delivery. After that receipt exists, ordinary edits finish with directly relevant unit/component and browser checks; a repeated bare delivery command exits before inventory, integrity, planning, build, tests, export, browser, or checkpoint writes.
- Source/reference checked: The previous functional-targeted delivery implementation, protected lifecycle/plan/receipt/checkpoint modules, CLI generated-product fixtures, documentation mirrors, and a freshly generated standalone product exercised through its initial build and one later material edit.
- Reference inputs: None. This is a workflow contract change derived from the user's explicit development-lifecycle requirements.
- Docs/contracts read: `workflow.md`, `acceptance-testing.md`, `core/performance.md`, `performance.md`, the root and generated `AGENTS.md`, and runtime performance verification policy.
- Contract rules applied: `workflow-required`, `acceptance-product-observable`, and `performance-coverage-levels`.
- View interaction intent: Unchanged. Verification phase selection does not alter a product's typed `viewInteraction` or renderer behavior.
- Interaction ownership: Unchanged. Product surfaces retain their existing owners; focused checks observe the edited product behavior without creating a second interaction surface.
- Decision: Treat the immutable initial delivery receipt as the phase boundary. Keep only two executable protected delivery plans: complete initial functional proof and exact request-authorized targeted performance. Delete later-functional semantic diff, verification-impact inventory, changed-file ownership resolution, and browser-impact selection instead of retaining dormant compatibility paths.
- Alternatives rejected: Repeating full delivery after every edit, an automatic later-functional aggregate gate, a new `verify:change` command, filename-based test inference, measured performance inferred from touched renderer files, and legacy receipt/impact compatibility branches.
- State/output mapping: Initial proof writes the durable delivery receipt once. Targeted performance updates only targeted performance history; full audit updates only the independent baseline. Ordinary later edits do not read current source inventory or mutate any checkpoint.
- Performance intent: ordinary-product-work
- Verification: The real generated-app lifecycle completed one full initial proof, then one exact material test and a byte-for-byte checkpoint-preserving delivery no-op. Starter tests passed 686/686 script tests and 420/420 Vitest tests; CLI passed 93 tests with three Windows-only skips; starter, CLI, runtime, website, docs, code health, and production build checks passed.
- Risks: Previously generated apps keep their copied version-1 lifecycle until regenerated or migrated. Focused later checks are intentionally selected by the agent from the edited behavior and do not mint aggregate functional evidence.

### Iteration 9 — Semantic focused feature verification

- Request: Keep later app edits fast while verifying that a change did not break semantically related behavior, and measure the effect on a real generated app.
- Task type: Starter/CLI workflow command, acceptance selection, Playwright orchestration, generated-app fixture, documentation, and verification.
- User-visible result: Later edits now run one exact unit/component test plus `pnpm test:feature -- <acceptance-id>`. A leaf behavior stays one browser scenario; a finite selector automatically expands to the acceptance peers required by current applicability semantics. Explicit `--all` remains product-only. No build, delivery, export matrix, framework self-test, or measured performance is added.
- Source/reference checked: Current acceptance applicability derivation, runtime evidence reporter, exact Playwright title resolver, protected delivery process, generated material fixture, and a fresh standalone lifecycle with a selector edit after initial delivery.
- Reference inputs: None. This is workflow behavior derived from the user's explicit later-edit speed and safety requirements.
- Docs/contracts read: `workflow.md`, `acceptance-testing.md`, `agent-worklog.md`, root/generated `AGENTS.md`, and the semantic focused verification design and implementation plan.
- Contract rules applied: `workflow-required`, `acceptance-product-observable`, `controls-component-layout-invariants`, and `performance-coverage-levels`.
- View interaction intent: Unchanged. The command selects product acceptance and does not alter renderer view ownership.
- Interaction ownership: Unchanged. Existing product controls and canvas operations remain their own interaction authorities.
- Decision: Start from explicit agent-authored acceptance IDs and compute a fixed-point closure through the canonical control applicability cases. Load current TypeScript app semantics through a strict Playwright reporter, validate a versioned JSON plan, resolve exact test titles, and run one worker against the current-source development server. Keep the existing runtime evidence reporter as the only outcome authority. Reuse a previous targeted-performance report only when its source hash equals the current source hash, so ordinary edits cannot create a false consecutive-performance comparison.
- Alternatives rejected: Repeating complete delivery, restoring changed-file impact inference, selecting tests from filenames, using stale production preview without rebuilding, adding a build to each later edit, silently falling back to all browser tests, and weakening branch/layout evidence.
- State/output mapping: The command reads current acceptance/schema/inventory, prints the selected IDs and browser scenarios, and produces ordinary test output only. It removes inherited delivery/performance authority and never reads or writes the protected checkpoint. The real lifecycle proved the initial checkpoint remained byte-for-byte unchanged.
- Performance intent: ordinary-product-work. No measured performance path or full audit was authorized or executed.
- Verification: Selector 6/6, plan codec 4/4, reporter 6/6, runner 5/5, starter scripts 697/697, starter Vitest 427/427, CLI 94 passed with three Windows-only skips, runtime 2144/2144, typechecks, docs sync, and the production build passed. The real fresh generated lifecycle selected six material control scenarios from `material.layer`, excluded material export and unrelated domains, used no later build, and preserved the initial checkpoint byte-for-byte. A direct one-scenario focused run took 21.08 s while installing the missing Playwright browser once, then 7.80 s warm; the browser phase itself reported 6.1 s on the warm run. No measured performance ran. The final thermo-nuclear pass also proved that same-source performance reports remain comparable while a changed source resets comparison to `none`.
- Risks: Previously generated apps keep their copied workflow until regenerated or deliberately migrated. A selector may legitimately select several browser scenarios when its entity contract declares multiple controls as semantic peers; this bounded cost is visible in command output.

### Iteration 10 — Structural redundant-control-label guards

- Request: Prevent generated applications from shipping useless visible labels, using the Dispersion `Spectrum` section and its `Color 1` through `Color 4` fields as failure evidence; change only the starter contract, not Dispersion.
- Task type: Focused starter acceptance-contract and documentation correction.
- User-visible result: Generated product schemas now fail acceptance when multiple sibling colors use sequential `Color N` labels or when a separately rendered field label repeats its section title. Useful role labels such as `Fill` and `Stroke` remain valid, and tabs retain a matching accessibility name without rendering duplicate text.
- Source/reference checked: The supplied Dispersion screenshot, its schema/worklog/browser receipt as read-only diagnostic evidence, `core/layout.md`, the copied starter acceptance validator, runtime label rendering, and existing control-label regression tests.
- Reference inputs: The screenshot is diagnostic evidence only. `/Users/kusnizza/Projects/toolcraft-apps/dispersion` remains outside the implementation scope and is unchanged.
- Contract rules applied: `controls-component-layout-invariants`, `controls-layout-heuristics`, and `workflow-required`.
- Root cause: Sequential labels were rejected only after vocabulary-based palette detection. `Spectrum` and `dispersion.customColorA` through `customColorD` did not match that vocabulary, so the invariant returned no errors. Duplicate section-title labels were checked only for switch/checkbox controls.
- Decision: Make `Color N` rejection depend only on multiple sibling color controls. Move section-title equality into the canonical general label policy, exclude tabs because their label is accessibility-only, and remove the switch-specific duplicate branch so one invariant owns the behavior.
- Alternatives rejected: Editing Dispersion, adding `Spectrum` or `customColor` to vocabulary lists, silently hiding invalid labels at runtime, introducing `labelIntent`, and retaining duplicate switch/general diagnostics.
- State/output mapping: Acceptance reads resolved app-authored control sections and emits blocking schema diagnostics before product delivery. Runtime state, rendering, controls, and generated applications are not mutated by this correction.
- Performance intent: ordinary-product-work. This validation-only edit adds no runtime workload and authorizes no measurement.
- Verification: The two focused label suites passed 13/13 tests; the complete starter app slice passed 430/430 tests; starter typecheck and local docs check passed.
- Risks: Previously generated applications retain their copied validator until regenerated or deliberately migrated.

### Iteration 11 — Canonical control values and selected-entity isolation

- Request: Prevent the Logos Grid class of failure where a color edit does not reach the selected object; strengthen only the Toolcraft runtime/starter contract and leave Logos Grid unchanged.
- Task type: Shared runtime value lifecycle, starter acceptance, protected browser evidence, contracts, docs, and generated propagation. No measured performance.
- User-visible result: Built-in controls now commit one canonical value representation at every state ingress. Selected-object property controls cannot pass acceptance unless two real product entities prove bidirectional pixel isolation and correct control rebinding.
- Source/reference checked: `/Users/kusnizza/Projects/toolcraft-apps/logos-grid` logs and source as read-only diagnostic evidence; runtime Color adapter, reducers, state creation, persistence/settings restoration, timeline keyframes, interaction ownership, Layers coverage, browser proof sessions, and generated-app integrity boundaries.
- Reference inputs: Logos Grid supplied diagnostic context only; no motion reference. Logos Grid and other generated application snapshots remain unchanged.
- Docs/contracts read: Runtime component and decision contracts; `schema-reference.md`; `component-rules.md`; `acceptance-testing.md`; root and generated `AGENTS.md`.
- Contract rules applied: `controls-product-coverage`, `interaction-surface-ownership`, `layers-enabled-behavior`, `acceptance-product-observable`, `persistence-policy-explicit`, and `workflow-required`.
- Root cause: Color UI emits `{ hex }`, while the old normalizer accepted both that payload and a string without canonicalizing them; initial/live/timeline paths did not share one schema codec. Existing whole-output selection evidence could also pass when a global or wrong entity changed.
- Decision: Use one exhaustive built-in codec registry and one schema-aware ingress policy for defaults, seeds, live commands, persistence, settings, and keyframes. Make property scope explicitly global or selected-entity and reuse one protected two-entity raster recipe for app-owned and `selectedLayer.*` properties.
- Alternatives rejected: Product-specific Color parsing, editing Logos Grid, a Color-only reducer branch, whole-canvas/signature evidence, one-direction selection tests, and separate layer/app selection algorithms.
- State/output mapping: Canonical decoded values enter runtime state/history/persistence/timeline before product consumers read them. Selected-entity ownership links the property target to its selection operation; protected actions select A/B on the declared surface and bounded pixel probes prove only the selected entity changes.
- Performance intent: ordinary-product-work. The request concerns functional integrity and supplies no performance authority.
- Verification: Focused runtime codec/state/Color/timeline tests, starter selection validator tests, protected Canvas/Panel provenance tests, bidirectional isolation, and adversarial cross-entity mutation rejection are required before the combined functional checks and thermo-nuclear review.
- Risks: Existing generated apps receive the corrected runtime and signed acceptance helpers only after regeneration or deliberate framework refresh. Custom product renderers must consume the canonical model and provide stable, non-overlapping entity probes for selected-entity proof.

### Iteration 12 — Infinity canvas scene continuity verification

- User-visible result: Finite → Infinity → finite now removes and restores only the artboard boundary; world position, camera offset/zoom, product/media/model nodes, custom-renderer CSS/backing, provider resources, and visible pixels do not jump or reset.
- Root-cause evidence: Finite and Infinity previously used different child-box origins, scene subtree shapes, product/media frames, and camera restoration behavior. Final VGPU diagnosis also found a background-only selector scheduling one paused frame and presentation-local frame counters resetting after resource retirement; those seams now preserve exact transition and teardown evidence.
- Decisions: Keep one centered zero-area world origin and one stable scene/product subtree. `sceneBoundsProvider` supplies the same live product rect in both modes, VGPU remains the single pinned preview/export provider, and canvas mode cannot fork renderer geometry or ownership.
- Image/export geometry: Decoded source pixels live in `sourceSize`, world presentation lives in the canonical scene-element frame, and every ingress normalizes once. Finite export clips that unchanged scene through the artboard; Infinity export outward-rounds the visible product/image/model contributor union while custom raster export presents through the same provider frame.
- Alternatives rejected: Renderer or scene remounts, camera-offset compensation, a dormant finite backing used as Infinity geometry, mode-specific image/model placement, DOM-derived bounds, and a second provider/export path.
- Evidence: Focused runtime/image/model/export suites, generated compile and VGPU lifecycle tests, and protected browser observations proved stable DOM identity, camera, rects, backing, allocations, operations, pixels, finite restoration, Infinity progress, and resource teardown. The required monorepo checks passed; website typecheck also passed from clean committed HEAD while unrelated local docs drift remained untouched.
- Generated proof record: The canonical compatibility runner enabled exact `vgpu@0.3.1` and `@vgpu/wgsl@0.3.1`, validated both WGSL shaders, and validated a version-8 protected initial-delivery checkpoint containing build, all required product tests, and all seven required VGPU scenarios; its complete browser run passed 15/15, including `browser vgpu: Infinity scene bounds` and teardown.
- Risks: Previously generated apps require regeneration to receive the canonical scene and image model. Future provider releases must pass the same pinned compatibility promotion path; custom renderers remain responsible for truthful mode-invariant scene bounds.

### Iteration 13 — Exhaustive finite-selector roles and bounded feature closure

- Request: Keep the fast post-delivery feature loop, but stop ordinary finite parameters from expanding unrelated control proof while preserving complete checks for selectors that genuinely change product branches.
- Task type: Starter acceptance semantics, focused feature selection, runtime contracts, CLI document guards, generated documentation, and worklog authority. No measured performance.
- User-visible result: Every bounded finite product selector now declares one explicit `branch` or `parameter` role. Parameters prove only their own accepted outcome and option coverage; branches re-prove only exact declared always-visible peers plus dependents already named by `applicability` predicates.
- Root cause: The previous contract treated every finite sibling selector as a proof branch. That protected missing predicates but made ordinary choices such as format or character fan out across unrelated controls. The first implementation narrowed the executable graph, while review found stale all-sibling wording in runtime contracts, negative CLI guards, and the Slider website page.
- Source/reference checked: The finite-selector inventory validator and dependency index, applicability-case derivation, version-2 feature selection, runtime decision/component contracts, generated docs assertions, starter/website schema examples, and Slider decision rules. No external reference input applies.
- Contract rules applied: `controls-product-coverage`, `controls-section-inventory-required`, `acceptance-product-observable`, and `workflow-required`.
- Decision: Require exhaustive `finiteSelectors` classification with no default or inference. A `branch` lists only exact always-visible same-entity peers in `affectedTargets`; explicit predicates add their dependents automatically and force their owners to be branches. A `parameter` adds no peer edge. Continuous controls remain outside the inventory, and an empty inventory remains explicit.
- Alternatives rejected: Target-name exceptions, control-type defaults, optional selector roles, duplicating predicate dependents in `affectedTargets`, runtime Setup fallback, and section-wide finite-selector fanout.
- State/output mapping: The inventory validator fails malformed or incomplete role declarations. One canonical dependency index feeds both applicability cases and focused feature closure, so browser selection follows the same branch/predicate graph that acceptance proves.
- Performance intent: ordinary-product-work. The change narrows functional selection and does not authorize benchmarks or measured performance.
- Verification: Runtime contract suites passed 202/202 and runtime/CLI typechecks passed. Starter docs and website component-doc checks passed; the starter/website schema examples are byte-identical. CLI docs-guard tests passed 6/6, and the named generated-app test passed the new selector guards before reaching the unchanged historical `Generated receipt` wording conflict in Iteration 12.
- Risks: Previously generated apps retain copied all-sibling guidance until regenerated or deliberately migrated. A branch can still select multiple scenarios by design, but only through explicit affected peers and predicates visible in the inventory.

### Iteration 14 — Focused browser authority and bounded post-delivery proof

- User-visible result: After the initial delivery, `test:feature` runs one exact selected browser scenario without global catalog work while rejecting timeout, loader, proxy, callback, external-package, config, and reporter paths that could bypass protected evidence.
- Source and contract checked: The version-2 feature plan, product-test facade, Playwright authority inventory, canonical local dependency graph and TypeScript alias resolver, proof-process deadline/cleanup authority, integrity manifest, generated demand-only lifecycle, and the post-first-delivery workflow in `AGENTS.md`.
- Decision: Keep the exact acceptance `{file,testName,budget}` plan as the only focused execution authority. Inspection creates one immutable preflight snapshot containing the signed manifest bytes, digest, parsed authority and domain; present/absent receipts for the runtime/UI domain markers and every Vite/Playwright config candidate; Node search/scope directory membership; package contents, manifests, real paths, and resolution decisions. Seal creation consumes that snapshot and may only compare current filesystem state with it, never establish a later baseline. Revalidate the resulting seal immediately before source loading, after source-plan loading, and again before Playwright spawn; then validate the selected browser closure and revalidate it at the same execution boundary. The signed `starter` and `generated` manifest domains are distinct: starter authority is bound to its exact package and absent copied-runtime markers, while generated authority requires present runtime evidence and the canonical protected trust-root coverage. Presence and absence are both authority, so restoring a hidden runtime, adding a higher-precedence config, or introducing a resolvable package cannot change the domain between stages. Inspect strict Playwright and reporter dependencies through local relays, preserve intrinsic and higher-order provenance through aliases and callback arguments, reject unresolved loading throughout every traversed external executable package, and resolve containment by path segments rather than string prefixes.
- Superseded design: Iteration 9 established the fast-loop intent, but its path-only facade seal and permissive unresolved-module behavior are no longer current. The present runner binds the full inspected execution closure and uses the canonical graph instead of e2e filename or package-name heuristics.
- Alternatives rejected: Playwright title grep, whole-suite collection, arbitrary external modules treated as safe, package allowlists, repo-path heuristics, mutable config trust, unbounded Chromium installation, and separate Proxy/Reflect or callback exception paths.
- State/output mapping: The isolated current-source loader produces the canonical plan; authority validation maps its selected files to one graph, one inspected external boundary, and one byte seal. The protected facade applies plan budgets before fixtures, the reporter accepts only selected plan rows, and the proof process owns wall deadlines and descendant cleanup.
- Verification: Focused Playwright authority, config/preflight authority, runner, resolver, source-loader, and proof-process suites passed 83/83 in 2.7 seconds; the exact three-file CLI gate passed 19/19; CLI and starter typechecks, `pnpm starter:docs-check`, and `pnpm ai:check` passed. `pnpm --dir starter test:feature -- persistence.reload` passed its exact browser scenario 1/1, including mandatory signed preflight and pre-spawn snapshot revalidation, and `node --test cli/src/generate-demand-only-lifecycle.test.mjs` passed 1/1 in 139 seconds. Measured performance was not run because this is a functional post-delivery loop.
- Risks: Third-party runtime helpers must remain statically resolvable and inspectable inside the project dependency boundary. Previously generated apps require regeneration to receive this authority model, and future Playwright config executable fields must be added through the same canonical resolver and signed trust boundary.

## Decisions

### Renderer

- Decision: No product renderer yet.
- Reason: The starter is intentionally neutral.
- Evidence: No `canvasContent` product renderer is declared. The neutral composition still declares `modelPresentation: { mode: "runtime" }` so future model uploads have one standard owner until a product explicitly declares checked custom consumers.

### Timeline

- Decision: No timeline yet.
- Reason: The starter has no product animation behavior.
- Evidence: `panels.timeline` is omitted.

### Layers

- Decision: No layers yet.
- Reason: The starter has no layer workflow.
- Evidence: `panels.layers` is omitted.

### Controls

- Decision: No product controls yet.
- Reason: Controls are added only after the requested product behavior is known.
- Evidence: The starter schema exposes no product control sections.

### View Interaction

- Decision: No spatial product view yet.
- Reason: The neutral starter has no visible three-dimensional scene or model.
- Evidence: Product readiness remains in starter mode; product apps must declare typed `viewInteraction` before controls or renderer code.

### Interaction Ownership

- Decision: No product interaction surfaces yet.
- Reason: The neutral starter has no canvas handles or product controls to compare.
- Evidence: Product apps must declare typed `interactionOwnership` before implementing controls or canvas interactions.

### Export

- Decision: No product export yet.
- Reason: Export actions are added when the app has product output.
- Evidence: No sticky product `panelActions` are declared.

### Performance

- Decision: No product performance workload yet.
- Reason: Performance scenarios depend on renderer and control workload.
- Evidence: The starter performance matrix is a neutral baseline.

## Evidence

- Source reviewed: neutral starter schema and local Toolcraft docs.
- Contract applied: starter baseline remains neutral until product behavior exists; `model-appearance-presentation` keeps package import, appearance leases, model canvas output, gizmo pose, and export ownership explicit.

## Verification

Protected receipts own changed files, the derived plan, commands, selectors, reports, measurements, and pass/fail evidence. Decision Trail iterations record only one bare `pnpm verify:delivery` narrative.

## Risks

- Risk: This template must be replaced with product-specific decisions before final delivery.
- Risk: A product that selects custom model presentation must mount every declared checked consumer; otherwise runtime reports typed retryable presentation feedback and suppresses only that declared target.
